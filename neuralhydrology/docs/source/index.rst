Welcome to neuralHydrology's documentation!
===========================================

This is the documentation for the ``neuralHydrology`` Python package.
The source code is available on `GitHub <https://github.com/neuralhydrology/neuralhydrology/>`_.

On this documentation page, you'll find a :doc:`quickstart guide <usage/quickstart>` with step-by-step instructions on installation, required datasets, and command-line usage.
We've also written a few :doc:`tutorials <tutorials/index>` that walk you through code examples to train your first models.
The :doc:`modelzoo <usage/models>` lists all the models that come pre-packaged on installation (but you can add your own models, too).
Finally, the :doc:`API docs <api/neuralhydrology>` show in-depth information on all modules, classes, and functions within ``neuralHydrology``.

You might also be interested in our `Research Blog <https://neuralhydrology.github.io/>`_, where once in a while we post news about our papers and other projects.

The documentation is still work-in-progress. Stay tuned for a lot of updates during the next days/weeks, as well as
a handful of tutorials.
