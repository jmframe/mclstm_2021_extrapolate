class TemplateDataset(BaseDataset):
    """Template class for adding a new data set.
    
    Each dataset class has to derive from `BaseDataset`, which implements most of the logic for preprocessing data and 
    preparing data for model training. Only two methods have to be implemented for each specific dataset class: 
    `_load_basin_data()`, which loads the time series data for a single basin, and `_load_attributes()`, which loads 
    the static attributes for the specific data set. 
    
    Usually, we outsource the functions to load the time series and attribute data into separate functions (in the
    same file), which we then call from the corresponding class methods. This way, we can also use specific basin data
    or dataset attributes without these classes.
    
    To make this dataset available for model training, don't forget to add it to the `get_dataset()` function in 
    'neuralhydrology.datasetzoo.__init__.py'

    Parameters
    ----------
    cfg : Config
        The run configuration.
    is_train : bool 
        Defines if the dataset is used for training or evaluating. If True (training), means/stds for each feature
        are computed and stored to the run directory. If one-hot encoding is used, the mapping for the one-hot encoding 
        is created and also stored to disk. If False, a `scaler` input is expected and similarly the `id_to_int` input
        if one-hot encoding is used. 
    period : {'train', 'validation', 'test'}
        Defines the period for which the data will be loaded
    basin : str, optional
        If passed, the data for only this basin will be loaded. Otherwise the basin(s) are read from the appropriate
        basin file, corresponding to the `period`.
    additional_features : List[Dict[str, pd.DataFrame]], optional
        List of dictionaries, mapping from a basin id to a pandas DataFrame. This DataFrame will be added to the data
        loaded from the dataset, and all columns are available as 'dynamic_inputs', 'evolving_attributes' and
        'target_variables'
    id_to_int : Dict[str, int], optional
        If the config argument 'use_basin_id_encoding' is True in the config and period is either 'validation' or 
        'test', this input is required. It is a dictionary, mapping from basin id to an integer (the one-hot encoding).
    scaler : Dict[str, Union[pd.Series, xarray.DataArray]], optional
        If period is either 'validation' or 'test', this input is required. It contains the means and standard 
        deviations for each feature and is stored to the run directory during training (train_data/train_data_scaler.p)
